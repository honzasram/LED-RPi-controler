LED-RPi-controler
=================

Software and desctription of hardware for project. 

Brain of this project is Raspberry Pi. To this simple piece of computer is connected module for PWM and to that is attached some transistors for controlling RGB LED strips.
That is only HW. All is controlled by user via interface. IT is based on web but also it can be some buttons. It depends on you and you style.

What is needed:
you have to use Adafruit 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Driver - I2C interface - PCA9685
also it is needed to have installed i2c-tools, screen and python
