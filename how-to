We will most probablz rewite this project to C++ and make from that  reliable application.
what will be needed: 
  - check gnublin-api
  - rewrite program using gnublin api
  - test it hard!

Why? because so far in python it is using almost 50% of CPU time and it is using mysql. and we don't like it. 
that's why.
dot for the idiot
